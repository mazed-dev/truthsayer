# Archaeologist integration to browser's address bar

Archaeologist is integrated to browser's address bar using ["omnibox"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/omnibox) browser extension API.

When the user focuses the browser's address bar and starts typing, the browser displays a drop-down list containing suggested pages, based on what they typed. This gives the user a quick way to access, for example, pages from their history or bookmarks.
The archaeologist customises it adding items from users Mazed to a drop-down list. To trigger Mazed search, user has to type keyword followed by space and phrase to search for in Mazed.
