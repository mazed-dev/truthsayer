# Text Information Retrieval

Collection of search related things, pure TS/JS. Please don't use React here.

Note(Alexander): The reason to separate it all into a separate workspace is a
quirkiness of dependency packages, some of them require odd settings for tests,
some for typescript. It's just easier to deal with all the odds in separate
workspace to avoid side effects on other code.

For React components please use [elementary](../elementary) workspace instead.
