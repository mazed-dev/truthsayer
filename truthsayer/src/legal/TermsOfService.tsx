# Terms Of Service

_Effective 10 October 2022_

These terms of service (**"Terms"**) apply to your access and use of [https://mazed.se](https://mazed.se) (the **"Site"**) and browser extension (the **“Browser Plugin”**). Please read the Terms, Cookies Policy and our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy) carefully.

The Site and the Browser Plugin are collectively called the **"Services"**.


## Accepting these Terms

By using our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms, Cookies Policy and Privacy Policy. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the Service. Also, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by emailing [mazed@fastmail.com](mailto:mazed@fastmail.com).

As used in these Terms, "we," "us" , "our", and Mazed refer to ASG Mazed Inc., and "you" and "your" refer to you as an individual and the User of our Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.


## Privacy Policy

Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy.


## Cookies Policy

Please refer to our [Cookies Policy](./cookies-policy) for information on how we use Cookies.


## Changes to these Terms

We may modify the Terms at any time, at our sole discretion. If we do so, we'll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It's important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion. You should periodically review the most up-to-date version of the Terms of Service found at [https://mazed.se/terms-of-service](https://mazed.se/terms-of-service).


## Who can use Mazed

You can only use Mazed if you can legally form a binding contract with Mazed, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. When you create your Mazed account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information. You can’t use Mazed if it would be prohibited by US sanctions. Any use or access by anyone under the age of 13 is not allowed. If you’re based in the EEA, you can only use Mazed if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country. Using Mazed may include downloading software to your computer, phone, tablet or another device. You agree that we may automatically update that software, and these Terms will apply to any updates.


## Account

If you want to use the Services you'll have to create an account (**"Account"**). You can do this via the Site.  It's important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don't, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account.


## Termination

Mazed may terminate or suspend your right to access or use Mazed for any reason with appropriate notice. We may terminate or suspend your access immediately and without notice, if we have a good reason. Upon termination, you will continue to be bound by these Terms.


## Security

We care about the security of our users. While we work to protect the security of your content and account, Mazed can’t guarantee that unauthorized third parties won’t be able to defeat our security measures. We ask that you keep your password secure. Please notify us immediately of any compromise or unauthorized use of your account.


## Intellectual Property

The Service and all contents, including but not limited to text, images, graphics or code are the property of Mazed, and are protected by copyright, trademarks, database and other intellectual property rights. You may display and copy, download or print portions of the material from the different areas of the Service only for your own non-commercial use. Any other use is strictly prohibited and may violate copyright, trademark and other laws. These Terms do not grant you a license to use any trademark of Mazed, or its affiliates. You further agree not to use, change or delete any proprietary notices from materials downloaded from the Service.


## User-Generated Content

“Your Data” means any data and content that you upload, store, retrieve, or otherwise make available through the Service. You retain all of the rights to Your Data. You agree to grant Mazed, a license to store, retrieve, backup, restore, and otherwise copy Your Data so that we may provide you with the Service.


## Third-Party Services

From time to time, we may provide you with links to third-party websites or services that we do not own or control. Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third party. Your use of such third-party applications, websites, and services is governed by that party's own terms of service or privacy policies. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third-party application, website or service that you visit or use.


## Disclaimers

The Services are under development at this time and are provided on an "as is" basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. If you are accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that: (i) the Services may not operate properly or be fully functional, and may contain errors, design flaws or other problems; (ii) use of the Services may result in unexpected results, corruption, or loss of data, information, content or communications, or other unpredictable damage or loss; and (iii) we have no obligation to release a final version of the Services. You assume all risks arising from the use of the Services, including, without limitation, the risk of corruption or loss of data, information or content.


## Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Mazed and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents harmless, from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Services, (ii) Your Content and (iii) your violation of these Terms.


## Arbitration

For any dispute you have with Mazed, you agree to first contact us and try to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we need to contact you, we will do so using the email address on your Mazed account. If Mazed has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms through binding arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in a small claims court.

Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. For instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery and is subject to very limited review by courts. Although the process is more informal, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, the US Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Mazed are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Mazed account.

Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. You can find their forms at[ www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). Unless you and Mazed agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county (or parish) where you reside. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, or through a telephone hearing or in-person hearing as established by the AAA rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Mazed ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU. To the extent that any claim, dispute or controversy regarding Mazed or our Service is not arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise, you and Mazed both agree that any claim or dispute regarding Mazed will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms.

If you are a consumer in the EEA, “Arbitration” does not apply to you.


## Governing law and jurisdiction

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If you are not a consumer in the EEA, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is New Castle County, Delaware, and our dispute will be determined under Delaware law.

If you are a consumer in the EEA, this will not deprive you of any protection you have under the law of the country where you live and access to the courts in that country.


## General Terms


### Notification procedures and changes to these Terms

We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing you with notifications, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if that is what we decide. We may revise these Terms from time to time; the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our discretion, is material, we will notify you. By continuing to access or use Mazed once revisions have become effective, you agree to be bound by the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, please stop using Mazed.


### Assignment

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Mazed without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

If you’re a consumer in the EEA, either you or Mazed may assign this agreement, and any rights and licenses granted under it, to a third party. In case of such an assignment by Mazed, you are entitled to terminate the agreement with immediate effect by deactivating your account. Mazed will provide you with reasonable notice of any such assignment.


### Entire agreement/severability

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and additional agreements you may enter into with Mazed, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Mazed concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.


### No waiver

No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Mazed's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
