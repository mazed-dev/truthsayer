# Privacy Policy

**Updated 2023/02/26**


## Introduction

Mazed exists to allow Users to instantly access and use their memory. This could not be done without the trust of our users. A fundamental piece of earning that trust means being clear about how we use your information and protecting your human right to privacy by collecting the minimum amount of information necessary.

This Privacy Policy explains the practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information received through the Services of ASG Mazed Inc. (“Mazed”, “we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our [Terms of Service](https://mazed.se/terms-of-service). So, please make sure that you have read and understood our [Terms of Service](https://mazed.se/terms-of-service).

This Privacy Policy applies to both registered **“Members”** and unregistered **“Visitors”** for use of the Services, and any individual or entity that uses the Services (as defined below), who are all hereinafter referred to as **“User(s)”**.  By accessing or using our Services, the User is entering into a legally binding agreement (either individually or on behalf of a Company) that includes the Mazed [Terms and Conditions](https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions) and this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies to all Users of mazed.se and all other Mazed websites, apps, developer platforms, management and transaction services, premium services, other products and services offered by Mazed, or any content or information provided as part of these services, including our blog (collectively, the **“Services”**).

This Privacy Policy is effective upon use of any Mazed Services by all Users.


## Types of Information Collected

Mazed collects the minimum amount of information necessary to provide our services, and does so by storing User information locally on User devices. Only the information stated below is collected by Mazed on Mazed’s servers.

We may collect certain anonymized information from **Visitors** to the mazed.se website, including your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, your user agent, the pages you visit on the Mazed website, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details. This information is collected for the purpose of improving our website and providing you with a better User experience. We may also use this information to analyze User behavior, troubleshoot technical issues, and comply with legal requirements. By visiting the Mazed website, you consent to the collection and use of this information as described in this Privacy Policy.

As a registered User of Mazed, we collect solely the information necessary to provide our services. The only personal information that we collect on our servers from Users is personal information for account registration, such as your name, email address, job title, and password; and any information you provide to us when contacting us through email or phone when contacting Mazed technical support, from here on all titled “Provided Data.” We collect this information to provide you with our services and to improve the User experience.


### Cookies

Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers to store their preferences. Mazed uses cookies for authorization when Users return to Mazed.se. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.

### Analytics

We also collect anonymized usage data for analytics through [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and [Posthog](https://posthog.com/) (“Service Providers''), such as network monitoring, clicks, mouse position, scroll, or keystroke logging. We may use this anonymized information to analyze User behavior, troubleshoot technical issues, and comply with legal requirements. By registering as a User of Mazed, you consent to the collection and use of this information as described in this Privacy Policy. Neither Mazed, nor our Service Providers, collect content or communications data of Users, such as messages, emails, or posts.

All other User data used by the Mazed web extension to provide its services, including communications, the list of web pages a User has visited, time the User spends on a page, scroll and mouse position, associated data such as page title and time of visits stored locally on the Users’ device, and content from visited web pages, is stored and processed locally on the User device, and not collected by ASG Mazed, Inc., nor by our Service Providers.

Personal information for authentication purposes and anonymized usage data is stored on our servers. Mazed uses servers that may be located anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States or other countries, abiding by guidelines and regulations of relevant legal jurisdictions. If User has any concern about providing information to Mazed as detailed in this Privacy Policy, User should not become a Member, visit our sites, applications, or otherwise use our Services.


## Use of User's Data

Mazed collects this Provided Data in order to provide the User with a safe, smooth, efficient and customized experience. User understands, accepts, and consents that Mazed is authorized to use User’s personal information in the following ways:

Mazed is authorized to use the User’s Provided Data to:

1. Provide the Services and client services support requested by User;
2. Resolve disputes, collect Fees, and troubleshoot problems;
3. Enforce the Mazed [Terms and Conditions](https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions) and this Privacy Policy;
4. Customize, measure and improve its Services and content;
5. Inform User about Service updates, changes, and promotions; and
6. Compare information for accuracy, and to verify it with third parties.


## Communication

Mazed may communicate with its Users via telephone, email, notices posted on the Mazed sites or apps, direct messages, and other means available through the Services. Communications may include welcome and setup communications, Service communications, promotional communications, and other account support communications. These communications will be sent to User based on User’s account information and communication preferences. User understands and acknowledges, however, that User cannot opt out of receiving Service communications from Mazed.


## Data Modification and Retention

The User can see, review and change most of its personal information by signing into User’s Mazed account. Generally, Mazed will not manually modify User’s Provided Data because it is difficult to verify your identity remotely. Accordingly, we strongly encourage, and sometimes require, Users to update their Provided Data directly in their Mazed account if it changes or is inaccurate.

Upon User’s written request, Mazed will close User’s account and remove User’s Provided Data from view as soon as reasonably practicable, based on User’s account activity and in accordance with applicable law. However, User acknowledges, understands and consents that Mazed may retain User’s Provided Data from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce the Mazed Terms and Conditions, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.

We store the Provided Data we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.


## Disclosure

Mazed may disclose Provided Data to respond to legal requirements, to enforce our policies, or to protect anyone’s rights or property. Accordingly, User’s information may be shared with:

* Members of the Mazed corporate family to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts;
* Service providers under contract who provide assistance for our business operations (such as fraud investigations and bill collection);
* Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, Mazed may disclose information relevant to the investigation.
* Other business entities, should Mazed plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. Should a merger or acquisition occur, Mazed will require that the new entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to User’s Provided Data. If User’s Provided Data will be used in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, User will receive notice.

Without limiting the authorizations under section “Security” hereof, and in an effort to respect User’s privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, Mazed will not otherwise disclose User’s Provided Data to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.


## Security

All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live.

We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use encryption, passwords, physical security and other security protocols to protect Users’ Provided Data against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmission or private communications made between User and Mazed or between Users of Mazed, and other Users may abuse or misuse Users’ personal information that they collect from the sites. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, User agrees to hold harmless Mazed in the event that a third party unlawfully intercepts or accesses any information provided by User to Mazed.


### Account Access

The User’s password is the key to the User's account. The User should use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and should not disclose its Mazed account password to anyone. If User does share its password or its personal information with others, User acknowledges and understands that User is responsible for all action taken in the name of User’s account. If User loses control of its password, User may lose substantial control over its personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on User’s behalf. If User’s password has been compromised for any reason, User should immediately contact and notify Mazed and User should change its password.


## Children’s Information

The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may contact us as set forth below. If we learn that we have collected a child’s personal information without parental consent in violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.


## Legal Bases

We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.


### If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.

Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.

Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:



* Send Users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services
* Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain Users
* Support our marketing activities

Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller" under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a "data processor" on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the "data controller" responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:


* If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way.
* For investigations and fraud detection and prevention.
* For business transactions provided certain conditions are met.
* If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim.
* For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin.
* If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be a victim of financial abuse.
* If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise. the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating.
* If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records.
* If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced.
* If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.
* If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations.


### If you are located in California, this section applies to you.
