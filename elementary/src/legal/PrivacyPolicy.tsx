# Privacy Policy

Mazed exists to give you the ability to make your memory instantly accessible to yourself. This could not be done without the trust of our users. A fundamental piece of earning that trust means being clear about how we use your information and protecting your human right to privacy.  This Privacy Policy explains the practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information received through the Services of ASG Mazed Inc. (“Mazed”, “we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.

Please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our [Terms and Conditions](https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions). So, please make sure that you have read and understood our [Terms and Conditions](https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions).


## Introduction

This Privacy Policy applies to both registered **“Members”** and unregistered **“Visitors”** for use of the Services, and any individual or entity that uses the Services (as defined below), who are all hereinafter referred to as **“User(s)”**.  By accessing or using our Services, the User is entering into a legally binding agreement (either individually or on behalf of a Company) that includes the Mazed [Terms and Conditions](httcps://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions) and this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies to all Users of mazed.se and all other Mazed websites, apps, developer platforms, management and transaction services, premium services, other products and services offered by Mazed, or any content or information provided as part of these services, including our blog (collectively, the **“Services”**).

This Privacy Policy is effective upon use of any Mazed Services by all Users.

This Privacy Policy describes how we handle Users’ personal information for the Services. By accepting this Privacy Policy, User expressly consents to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of User’s personal information by Mazed as described in this Privacy Policy.

Mazed may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice by email, to the email address on file in User’s account at the time of notice. Immediately after such notice has been provided to User, continued use of the Services constitutes User’s understanding, consent and acceptance of this Privacy Policy.


## Collection


### Data Controllers

Mazed uses servers that may be located anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States or other countries. If User has any concern about providing information to Mazed as detailed in this Privacy Policy, User should not become a Member, visit our sites, applications, or otherwise use our Services.


### Account Registration

When User creates an account on Mazed, User may be required to provide some personal information, including, but not limited to, User’s name, email address, home, work, or mobile telephone number, facility address, mailing address, bank account information, credit card number, and a password. User will also be required to agree to the Mazed Terms and Conditions (https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions) which includes our User Agreement, Terms of Service, and this Privacy Policy. Once User provides this information to Mazed, User is no longer anonymous to us. When User provides us with its personal and financial information, User consents to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers, which may be located anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States or other countries.


### Client Services

When User contacts our Client Services support team, either by email or phone, Mazed may access User’s account, settings, preferences, emails, and other contributions to our Services and collect the information needed to categorize User’s question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our Terms and Conditions ([https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions](https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions)) or this Privacy Policy. Mazed will also use this information to track potential problems and trends and customize support responses to better serve our Users.

By using our Services, User understands that Mazed may collect the following information, in addition to the information in section “Account Registration”:



* Correspondence through our sites, or correspondence sent to any Mazed employee or email address, or via telephone correspondence;
* Any other information provided during User’s interaction with the site, Services, and content, including, but not limited to, computer and network information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from sites, IP addresses and standard web log information; and
* Information from other companies, generation reporting companies, such as demographic and traffic data.

Mazed’s Services are constantly evolving, as we work to continue to provide the best suite of Services to our Users. The introduction of new Services may result in the collection of new information. Additionally, new partnerships or corporate mergers or acquisitions may result in new Services that require the collection of new information. If we start collecting substantially new types of personal or financial information in a way that materially impacts how we handle our Users’ data, we will modify this Privacy Policy with notice to Users.

Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information

We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your devices that allow us and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.

Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.

Pixel Tags/Web Beacons: A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information about engagement on the Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

Analytics: We may also use third-party service providers to collect and process analytics and other information on our Services. These third-party service providers may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other storage technology to collect and store analytics and other information. They have their own privacy policies addressing how they use the analytics and other information and we do not have access to, nor control over, third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

Information Collected from Users’ Devices and Networks. When User visits or leaves our Services (whether as a Member of Visitor) by clicking a hyperlink, or when User views a third party website that includes our Cookies or similar technology, Mazed automatically receives the URL of the site from which User comes or the one to which User is directed. Mazed receives information regarding the web pages, features and files which User browsed, time spent on those pages or features, search forms, links that a User clicks on and transitions the User took between those pages or features, and other statistics. Additionally, Mazed receives the internet protocol (**“IP”**) address of User’s company or the proxy server that User uses to access the web, User’s computer operating system details, User’s type of web browser, User’s mobile device (including User’s mobile device identifier provided by User’s mobile device operating system), User’s mobile operating system (if User is accessing Mazed via a mobile device), and the name of User’s ISP or mobile carrier. Mazed may also receive location data passed to us from a third party service provider or GPS-enabled devices that User has set up, which Mazed may use to show User’s local information and for fraud prevention and security purposes. User understands that most mobile devices have settings to disable the sharing of real-time location data, and that User should enable these settings if it does not wish to share this information with Mazed.

Social Media Widgets. A **“Widget”** is a stand-alone application used on our sites to display information or to invite Users to interact with the sites and Services in a variety of ways. Such Widgets include the Facebook “Like” button and the Twitter “Tweet”, or any other “Share” button that allows the User to share content on a number of social media websites. These Widgets may collect User’s IP address, which page User is visiting on our sites, and may set a Cookie to enable the feature to function properly. The User understands that social media features and Widgets are hosted by a third party or directly on our sites. Irrespective of host, User understands that these features are governed by the third party privacy policies of the company providing the feature.


## Use of User's Data

Mazed collects personal and financial information in order to provide the User with a safe, smooth, efficient and customized experience. User understands, accepts, and consents that Mazed is authorized to use User’s personal and financial information in the following ways:


### General

Mazed is authorized to use the User’s personal and financial information to:



1. Provide the Services and client services support requested by User;
2. Resolve disputes, collect Fees, and troubleshoot problems;
3. Enforce the Mazed [Terms and Conditions](https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions) and this Privacy Policy;
4. Customize, measure and improve its Services and content;
5. Inform User about Service updates, changes, and promotions; and
6. Compare information for accuracy, and to verify it with third parties.


### Communication

Mazed may communicate with its Users via telephone, email, notices posted on the Mazed sites or apps, direct messages, and other means available through the Services. Communications may include welcome and setup communications, Service communications, promotional communications, and other account support communications. These communications will be sent to User based on User’s account information and communication preferences. User understands and acknowledges, however, that User cannot opt out of receiving Service communications from Mazed.

User consents to receive autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages at the telephone number provided on the User’s account, or at any other telephone number provided by the User to Mazed, regardless of whether the telephone number is a home, work, or mobile telephone number. Where applicable and permitted by law, User may decline to receive certain communications by opting out via express written notice to Mazed.


### Data Analysis

Mazed may share certain de-identified User data with companies with whom Mazed co-markets, partners, and collaborates for their analysis and internal use to provide Users with additional Services. Mazed may use and disclose de-identified data shared with Mazed either by the User or a third party providing data on behalf of the User, for any purpose. Any and all of this information may be aggregated with information from other Users or may be provided individually in a redacted format as an example of User experience and our Services. Mazed is also expressly authorized by User to share with third parties, aggregate and/or de-identified data, including User’s use of the Services provided to User by Mazed. However, Mazed will collect and share additional, identified and/or personal location information about User as specified under Section “Collection” and as detailed in the Mazed [Terms and Conditions](https://mazed.se/terms-and-conditions).


### Data Sharing with Third Parties

In addition to the sharing specified in section “Data Analysis” hereof, Mazed may disclose User’s personal and financial information to third party service providers who assist Mazed in providing our Services. User understands and accepts that Mazed may contract with other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf, or to provide User with certain services. This includes, but is not limited to, processing credit card payments, issuing ACH deposits, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data, and providing marketing assistance. These third parties will only have access to personal information to the extent necessary to perform their intended function or service and are not authorized to use it for other purposes.


### Marketing

Mazed will not sell or rent User’s personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without User’s explicit consent. However, Mazed reserves the right to use User’s information to improve and personalize its Services and content. If User does not wish to receive marketing communications from us, User may indicate this preference at the bottom of Mazed’s marketing emails.

Spam. Mazed does not tolerate “Spam”. User is not licensed to add other Mazed Users to User’s mailing list (email or postal mail) without that User’s express written consent. To report Mazed-related Spam or Spoof emails to Mazed, User should forward the suspected Spam or Spoof email to Mazed with a notice that the email may be Spam or Spoof. The User may not use Mazed’s communication channels to send Spam or otherwise send content that would violate the Mazed User Agreement. Mazed automatically scans and may manually filter messages to check for Spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, and Mazed does not permanently store messages sent through these filters.


## Security

All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use encryption, passwords, physical security and other security protocols to protect Users’ personal and financial information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmission or private communications made between User and Mazed or between Users of Mazed, and other Users may abuse or misuse Users’ personal information that they collect from the sites. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, User agrees to hold harmless Mazed in the event that a third party unlawfully intercepts or accesses any information provided by User to Mazed.

Account Access. User’s password is the key to User’s account. The User should use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and should not disclose its Mazed account password to anyone. If User does share its password or its personal information with others, User acknowledges and understands that User is responsible for all action taken in the name of User’s account. If User loses control of its password, User may lose substantial control over its personal and financial information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on User’s behalf. If User’s password has been compromised for any reason, User should immediately contact and notify Mazed and User should change its password.


## Data Modification and Retention

The User can see, review and change most of its personal and financial information by signing into User’s Mazed account. Generally, Mazed will not manually modify User’s personal or financial information because it is difficult to verify your identity remotely. Accordingly, we strongly encourage, and sometimes require, Users to update their personal and financial information directly in their Mazed account if it changes or is inaccurate.

Upon User’s written request, Mazed will close User’s account and remove User’s personal and financial information from view as soon as reasonably practicable, based on User’s account activity and in accordance with applicable law. However, User acknowledges, understands and consents that Mazed may retain User’s personal and financial information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce the Mazed Terms and Conditions, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.

We store the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.


## Disclosure

Mazed may disclose personal or financial information to respond to legal requirements, to enforce our policies, or to protect anyone’s rights or property. Accordingly, User’s information may be shared with:



* Members of the Mazed corporate family to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts;
* Service providers under contract who provide assistance for our business operations (such as fraud investigations and bill collection);
* Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, Mazed may disclose information relevant to the investigation, including name, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, user ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, and bid and offer (order) history;
* Other business entities, should Mazed plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. Should a merger or acquisition occur, Mazed will require that the new entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to User’s personal and financial information. If User’s personal or financial information will be used in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, User will receive notice.

We may also share your personal information with other third parties, including other users, in the following circumstances:



* Databases Accessible by Other Users: When you submit personal information in a database that can be accessed by others, such personal information may be displayed to other users in the same or connected databases. For example, your personal information may be included in your notes or reminders in a database which can be viewed by other users collaborating with you in that database. Further, your email address or photo may be displayed with your database profile to other users collaborating with you in that database. This may apply to both Public Databases and Private Databases from within which you have shared a specific page.
* Share Content with Friends or Colleagues: Our Services may allow you to provide information about your friends, and may allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague, such as an invitation email.

Without limiting the authorizations under section “Security” hereof, and in an effort to respect User’s privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, Mazed will not otherwise disclose User’s personal or financial information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.


## Children’s Information

The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may contact us as set forth below. If we learn that we have collected a child’s personal information without parental consent in violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.


## Legal Bases

We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.

If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

- Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.

- Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.

- Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:


    - Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services
    - Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users
- Support our marketing activities
- Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities
    - Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience
    - improve the services provided to the user by Mazed and improve the user experience, and develop new services.
    - Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
    - Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller" under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a "data processor" on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the "data controller" responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.

**If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.**

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

  - If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way.
  - For investigations and fraud detection and prevention.
  - For business transactions provided certain conditions are met.
  - If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim.
  - For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin.
  - If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse.
  - If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating.
  - If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records.
  - If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced.
  - If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.
  - If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations.

**If you are located in California, this section applies to you.**

We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (ie. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.

If you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information. California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and

addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).
